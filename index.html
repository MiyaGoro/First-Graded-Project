          <p>Poppins and Georgia font combo is perfect if you want a good design but doing as little design as possible.</p>
          <p>Although Georgia may not be on your favorite list of fonts, you can’t deny its versatility and how well it works when displaying text on screens. This serif is a bit formal but will remain visible no matter the size of your screen.</p>
          <p>The intimate and friendly typographic personality of Georgia fits well with the geometric shape of Poppins. Its letterform has a perfect spacing between its character and height and will look greater either as its body text or heading.</p>
          <p>The almost monolinear letterform of Poppins complements the modern appeal and Old World beauty of Georgia quite well.</p>

          <p>If you want to give your design a modern and nonconformist font pair, use the combination of Bluu Next with Roboto. These typefaces offer various styles and amazing details that will not be left unseen.</p>
          <p>Additionally, you’ll achieve a reading that’s more natural mixed in with a contemporary vibe.
Bluu Next is a serif font. It is precise and sharp and it’s considered perfect for your brutalist designs.</p>
          <p>It’s a great choice for replacing those boring serifs such as the Times. The open and friendly curves of Roboto will complement its characteristics very well.</p>
          <p>Roboto is dual in nature and it doesn’t compromise its grotesque letterforms to force an unyielding rhythm which allows it to settle in its natural width.</p>
