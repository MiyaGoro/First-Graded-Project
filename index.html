          <p>Slabo is a collection of size-specific fonts for use in online advertising and other web uses. The collection currently includes this font, Slabo 27px, and Slabo 13px. Each font in the collection is fine-tuned for use at the pixel size in its name. The Slabo project is led by Tiro Typeworks, a type design foundry based in Canada.</p>
          <p>Lato is a sans serif typeface family started in the summer of 2010 by Warsaw-based designer Łukasz Dziedzic (“Lato” means “Summer” in Polish). In December 2010 the Lato family was published under the Open Font License by his foundry tyPoland, with support from Google.</p>
          <p>In the last ten or so years, during which Łukasz has been designing type, most of his projects were rooted in a particular design task that he needed to solve. With Lato, it was no different. Originally, the family was conceived as a set of corporate fonts for a large client — who in the end decided to go in a different stylistic direction, so the family became available for a public release.</p>
          <p>When working on Lato, Łukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially conflicting priorities. He wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite “transparent” when used in body text but would display some original traits when used in larger sizes. He used classical proportions (particularly visible in the uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same time, he created a sleek sans serif look, which makes evident the fact that Lato was designed in 2010 — even though it does not follow any current trend.</p>
          <p>The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness. “Male and female, serious but friendly. With the feeling of the Summer,” says Łukasz.</p>

          <p>Rufina combines features of several typographic styles with Bodoni forms found in the calligraphy of flexible tip pens. High contrast enables it to work well in text and headlines.</p>
          <p>PT Serif™ is the second pan-Cyrillic font family developed for the project “Public Types of the Russian Federation.” The first family of the project, PT Sans, was released in 2009.</p>
          <p>The fonts are released with a libre license and can be freely redistributed: The main aim of the project is to give the possibility to the people of Russia to read and write in their native languages.</p>
          <p>The project is dedicated to the 300 year anniversary of the civil type invented by Peter the Great in 1708–1710. It was given financial support from the Russian Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications.</p>
          <p>The fonts include standard Western, Central European and Cyrillic code pages, plus the characters of every title language in the Russian Federation. This makes them a unique and very important tool for modern digital communications.</p>
          <p>PT Serif is a transitional serif typeface with humanistic terminals. It is designed for use together with PT Sans, and is harmonized across metrics, proportions, weights and design.</p>
          <p>The family consists of six styles: regular and bold weights with corresponding italics form a standard font family for basic text setting; two caption styles in regular and italic are for use in small point sizes.</p>
          <p>Designed by Alexandra Korolkova, Olga Umpeleva and Vladimir Yefimov and released by ParaType in 2010.</p>

          <h3><span class="font-pair1a">Oswald Light</span> + <span class="font-pair1b">Esteban</span></h3>
          <p><b>CHANGE: A good combination of modern sans-serif typefaces</b></p>
          <p>Oswald is a reworking of the classic style historically represented by the 'Alternate Gothic' sans serif typefaces. The characters of Oswald were initially re-drawn and reformed to better fit the pixel grid of standard digital screens. Oswald is designed to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.</p>
          <p>Since the initial launch in 2011, Oswald was updated continually by Vernon Adams until 2014. Vernon added Light and Bold weights, support for more Latin and Cyrillic languages, tightened the spacing and kerning and made many glyph refinements throughout the family based on hundreds of users' feedback. In 2016 the Latin part of the family was updated by Kalapi Gajjar to complete the work started by Vernon. In January 2019, it was updated with a variable font Weight axis.</p>
          <p>Esteban is a typeface intended to be used in texts, specially literature and poetry. Its a serif font with medium contrast, tall x height, medium compression, and robust serifs. It offers personality, readability and economy.</p>
          <p>One of the most important features of Esteban is its stroke, that loses or gains weight in the stems. This feature was defined from the manuscripts of Jorge Alfredo Díaz Esteban, a writer who used a tool that can generate modulated strokes. This means the stroke width varies due to the pressure of the pen on the paper, and this quality allows the font to have a presence on the page that makes texts more dynamic. The precise level of contrast was decided by experimenting with various 'colors' of density that emerge in text settings. This allows Esteban to achieve good performance even in medium and low quality prints and as a web font.</p>
